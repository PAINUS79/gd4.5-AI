## Purpose
Minimal working top-down shooter demonstrating:
- TopDownMove2D usage
- Projectile system

- Combat mechanics

## Scene Structure
Coming soon - example scene will include:
- Player with 8-directional movement
- Shooting mechanic
- Enemy with chase state
- Health and damage system
