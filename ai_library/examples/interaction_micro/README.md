# Interaction Micro Example

## Purpose
Minimal working interaction system demonstrating:
- InteractionDetector usage
- Interactable objects
- UI feedback
- Event-driven design

## Scene Structure
Coming soon - example scene will include:
- Player with interaction detector
- Multiple interactable objects (chest, door, NPC)
- UI prompt system
- Signal-based communication

## How to Use
1. Load the main scene
2. Walk near interactable objects (UI prompt appears)
3. Press interact key (E or action button)
4. Observe different interaction behaviors

## Learning Points
- Area2D-based detection
- Signal connections
- UI prompts
- Decoupled interaction system
- Interactable component extension
