# Platformer Micro Example

## Purpose
Minimal working platformer demonstrating:
- PlayerMove2D usage
- Basic level design
- Health system integration
- Simple enemy with patrol AI

## Scene Structure
Coming soon - example scene will include:
- Player with movement and health
- Basic platforms and obstacles
- Patrol enemy
- Health pickup
- Win condition

2. Use arrow keys (move_left/move_right) and space (jump)
3. Avoid enemy, collect health, reach goal

## Learning Points
- InputMap configuration
- CharacterBody2D platformer physics
- Component composition (Health + Movement)
- State machine basics
